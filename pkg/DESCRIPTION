Description: Several tools for manipulating linear systems of equalities and/or
    inequalities. Includes reduction to reduced row echelon form, value substitution
    variable elimination (Gaussian elimination, Fourier-Motzkin elimination) and
    projecting a vector on the convex polytope described by a system of (in)equations.
