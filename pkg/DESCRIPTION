Description: Given a vector 'x' and a set of linear equalities 'Ax=b1' and a set of linear
    inequalities 'Bx<=b2' which 'x' has to satisfy. The successive projection algorithm 
    finds the closest (in weighted Euclidean sense) vector 'y' to 'x' that satisfies
    the constraints. Constraints may be defined in dense or sparse matrix representation.
